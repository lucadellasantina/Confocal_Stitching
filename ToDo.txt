Problems/Changes
 1) Save image stats for stacks all in one file
 2) Save in open-source format, not my custom crap format (bfsave.m)
 3) Add ability to remove channels from projections
     -Probably just remove from ViewStack
     -In general, clean up/clarify projection options
 4) Bugfix: rapidly repeating any action that results in replotting
            (e.g. removing channels) causes error
 5) On confocal main window, ability to zoom/pan
 6) Add ability to browse metadata for a stack/channel?
 7) Parallelize StitchStacks?
    -Currently not possible because stackStats changes:
      stackStats is used to interpolate in z without loading in each slice
      multiple times
    -At the moment, parallelized by channel
